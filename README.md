This project is a simple Rule-Based Eligibility Evaluation API built using Node.js and Express. The API evaluates whether a user satisfies a predefined set of eligibility rules.

The rules are parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and evaluated dynamically based on the user's data. The example in the project evaluates conditions such as age, department, salary, and experience to determine eligibility for certain criteria.
